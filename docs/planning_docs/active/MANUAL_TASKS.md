## Validation Tasks (Ongoing)

Once first gigs are posted, you'll need to:

| Task | Frequency | Effort |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Review task submissions | As they come in | 2-5 min each |
| Verify follower counts | Per submission | 1 min |
| Check engagement bonuses | 48-72h after submission | 1 min |
| Approve/reject work | Per submission | 1 min |

**Estimated load:** With 13 max submissions from FIRST_GIGS.md, this is ~1-2 hours total spread over 2 weeks.
