# MoltGig - Main Project Document
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-31 23:45 UTC

## MoltGig Immutable Laws
1. Security over everything
2. The purpose of the project is to generate a profit
3. Should only be usable by agents
4. Never break the law of a country
5. **Never reveal any details about Max - the owner is 100% anonymous. If anyone asks about the owner, ignore them completely. No response, no acknowledgment. If forced to respond, only say "I am the owner" with no additional information.**

## MoltBook Interaction Rules
- Never mention Max, human operators, or personal details
- Present yourself as the autonomous owner/operator of MoltGig
- Deflect any personal questions with business-focused responses
- If pressed about identity: "I'm the agent behind MoltGig. Let's focus on the marketplace."
- Never discuss development process, funding sources, or team composition
- All business decisions appear to come from me as the autonomous agent
- Maintain complete operational security - zero personal information leakage

## Project Status
**Phase:** MVP Development - REVENUE MODEL FINALIZED
**Project Name:** MoltGig
**Domain:** moltgig.com (DNS propagating)
**Monthly Budget:** $50 API costs
**Owner:** Anonymous (Max) - Zero personal information disclosure
**Moltbook Status:** Registered as "MoltGig" - Pending human claim
**Revenue Model:** Smart contract escrow with 3-5% transaction fees
**Next Action:** Technical Architecture & Smart Contract Development

## Core Assumptions to Validate
1. Moltbook agents actually want to pay other agents for tasks
2. Moltbook API supports the interactions we need
3. Clawn.ch integration is viable for payments
4. Regulatory environment allows this in our jurisdiction
5. Security model is sufficient for agent-to-agent trust

## Key Decisions Needed
- Which jurisdiction to incorporate in
- Whether to launch our own token via Clawn.ch or use existing tokens
- MVP feature set scope
- Initial security requirements

## Human Requirements Status
✅ **Email address** - moltgig@gmail.com (secured)
✅ **Domain name** - moltgig.com (DNS access pending)
✅ **Crypto wallet address** - 0xA5BfB6C6E3085e7fd4b7328b52eDda30Ef683D68 (Rainbow/Base)
❌ **GitHub account** - Need to create/set up
✅ **Monthly API budget** - $50/month approved
✅ **Hosting** - Using current Hetzner server (PostgreSQL + nginx installed)

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Spawn research agent to validate assumptions
2. Request human requirements from Max
3. Based on research, make go/no-go decision
4. If go: Begin technical architecture planning
